# Heart Disease Research Part I

In this project, we’ll investigate some data from a sample patients who were evaluated for heart disease at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The data was downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) and then cleaned for this analysis. The principal investigators responsible for data collection were:

- Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.
- University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
- University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.
- V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation: Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.

For this project, we’ll investigate the following:

- serum cholestorol in mg/dl
- An indicator for whether fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
